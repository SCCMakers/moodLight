# moodLight
The end goal of this project is to create a cheap and dirty version of the [Voronio Lamp](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/gov/voronoi101-light-your-lamp-a22a9e?use_route=project).

First we start out with the basic Blink program from the Arduino examples.  Then add red, green, and blue LEDs with a [3D printed cover to help blend the colors](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3473640). 
The code after this step should look [something like this](https://github.com/SCCMakers/moodLight/blob/master/rgb_blink.ino).

Wiring image made with Fritzing. 

Next is to make a pretty sequence by [editing this code](https://github.com/SCCMakers/moodLight/blob/master/rainbow_blink.ino) and getting the hex values [from a site like this](https://www.color-hex.com/color-palettes/).

Project in action. 

Next you can switch to an RGB LED and print [this LED cover](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3476106) and [this pretty cover](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1343925) before proceeding. 

Now you are ready for the [smooth rainbow](https://github.com/SCCMakers/moodLight/blob/master/smooth_rainbow.ino).  Can you edit the code to make it a smooth backwards rainbow?

[The slideshow for this activity can be found here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1d7Lc2nFzMsIrF1mCdFx3Lg3hAz3w9mfUrDsmHGg918g/edit?usp=sharing).  It includes all but the smooth rainbow.  In 40 minutes, most high school groups can get to RGB blink and advanced groups were able to get to Rainbow Blink.
