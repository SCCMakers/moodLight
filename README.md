The end goal of this project is to create a cheap and dirty version of the [Voronio Lamp](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/gov/voronoi101-light-your-lamp-a22a9e?use_route=project).

First we start out with the basic Blink program from the Arduino examples.  Then add red, green, and blue LEDs with a [3D printed cover to help blend the colors](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3473640). 
The code after this step should look something like this.
