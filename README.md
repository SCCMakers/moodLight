# moodLight
The end goal of this project is to create a cheap and dirty version of the [Voronio Lamp](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/gov/voronoi101-light-your-lamp-a22a9e?use_route=project).

First we start out with the basic Blink program from the Arduino examples.  Then add red, green, and blue LEDs with a [3D printed cover to help blend the colors](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3473640). 
The code after this step should look [something like this](https://github.com/SCCMakers/moodLight/blob/master/rgb_leds.ino).

Wiring image made with Fritzing. 

Next is to make a pretty sequence by [editing this code](https://github.com/SCCMakers/moodLight/blob/master/rainbowblink.ino) and getting the hex values [from a site like this](https://www.color-hex.com/color-palettes/).

Project in action. 

Next you can switch to an RGB LED and print [this LED cover](http://comingsoon.com) and [this pretty cover](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1343925) before proceeding.
